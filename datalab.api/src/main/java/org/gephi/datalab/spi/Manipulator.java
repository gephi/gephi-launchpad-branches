/**
 * <p>General and abstract manipulation action to use for Data Laboratory table UI and other actions like Graph context menu items in Overview.</p>
 * <p>Different subtypes of manipulators are defined for every type of action in the UI.</p>
 * <p>All manipulator types are able to:</p>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Execute an action</li>
 *  <li>Provide a name, description, type and order of appearance (position in group of its type)</li>
 *  <li>Indicate wether they have to be executable (enabled in the context menu) or not</li>
 *  <li>Provide and UI or not</li>
 *  <li>Provide and icon or not</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>Used for different manipulators such as NodesManipulator, EdgesManipulator and GeneralActionsManipulator.</p>
 * <p>The only methods that are called before setting up a manipulator (subtypes have special setup methods) with the data are getType and getPosition.
 * This way, the other methods behaviour can depend on the data that has been setup before</p>
