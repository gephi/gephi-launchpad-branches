        Import API/SPI provides the <b>import workflow</b> to import data form any
        support.
        <p>
            API is providing a secure workflow, from importers that connects to
            the data source (files, databases, spigots...) to the processors that
            append imported data to the workspace. It is based on the
            <code>Container</code> interface, that has a loading and unloading
            sub-interface. Importers are loading the container, then the controller
            is checking it's consistency and finally processors are unloading it.

            See <code>org.gephi.io.importer.spi</code> package to know how to define
            new data importers.
