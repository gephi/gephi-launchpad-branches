        <p>
            This API manage graph filtering. Its job is to execute filtering query
            to produce subgraphs. Filters are combined in queries that are passed
            to the system to be executed. The result of a filter query is a subgraph,
            a subset of the original graph that is represented as a
            <code>GraphView</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The role of the <code>FilterModel</code> is to
            host current queries. Each workspace has its <code>FilterModel</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The controller hosts the current <code>FilterModel</code>, for the
            current workspace.
