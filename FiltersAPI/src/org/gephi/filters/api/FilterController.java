/**
 * Use filters and queries for filtering the Graph. This controller manages
 * <code>FilterModel</code> instances. A model is defined for each workspace.
 * <p>
 * This controller is a singleton and can therefore be found in Lookup:
 * <pre>FilterController fc = Lookup.getDefault().lookup(FilterController.class);</pre>
 * <p>
 * The controller has two ways to execute filtering, a one-shot one that
 * immediately returns the <code>GraphView</code> and a more complex one suitable
 * for user interface interaction, with live parameter change.
 * <p>
 * The one-shot filtering can be executed like below:
 * <pre>
 * Filter filter = ...
 * Query query = controller.createQuery(filter);
 * GraphView view = controller.filter(query);
 * </pre>
 * The normal mode is to call {@link #filterVisible(org.gephi.filters.api.Query)}
 * which let this controller manage the execution. The benefit of this of this mode
 * is that properties change on filters are listened and filtering is automatically
 * reexecuted if values changes. See how to execute a filter with two different
 * values:
 * <pre>
 * Filter filter = ...
 * filter.getProperties()[0].setValue(1);       //Set value 1, for example a threshold
 * Query query = controller.createQuery(filter);
 * controller.add(query);
 * controller.filterVisible(query);     //A background thread executes the query
 * filter.getProperties[0].setValue(2)      //The background thread reexecute the query
 * </pre>
