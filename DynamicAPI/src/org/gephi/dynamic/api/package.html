        API responsible for dynamic states, including the current visible interval.
        <p>
            Gephi uses <b>Dynamic API</b> to store states relative to dynamic graph
            exploration. The most notable data is the current visible interval,
            what the timeline component is configuring. This interval is centralized
            here and used in the rest of the application.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>DynamicController</code> is managing models (one per workspace)
            and is the access door to the system. This controller is a service, and can be
            retrieved by using the following command:
        </p>
        <p><code>DynamicController dc = Lookup.getDefault().lookup(DynamicController.class);</code></p>
        <p>
            Use also the <code>DynamicModel</code> to get <code>DynamicGraph</code>
            instances. They are independent wrappers that can be used analyse
            dynamic graphs.
