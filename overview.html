        current status of each API. Each API is categorized by it's stability:
        stable, <span class="unstable">under development</span>, <span class="deprecated">deprecated</span> or

    <h2>API Changes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>(June 18 2010) Graph API event management improvements. The <code>GraphEvent</code> has now precise events, including
            <code>ADD_NODES</code>, <code>REMOVE_NODES</code>, <code>ADD_EDGES</code>, <code>REMOVE_EDGES</code> and
            <code>VISIBLE_VIEW</code>. A new <code>GraphEventData</code> interface has been created to retrieve elements related to
            the events.
        <li>(June 14 2010) Export API refactoring, inspired from ImportAPI. Create an <code>ExporterBuilder</code> interface for
            exporter creation and different exporters: <code>GraphExporter</code>, <code>VectorExporter</code>, <code>ByteExporter</code>
            and <code>CharacterExporter</code> that covers common cases. The way exporters write data has been rationalized by using either
            <code>java.io.Writer</code> (text) or <code>java.io.OutputStream</code> (byte). The <code>ExportController</code> has been improved
            to support all use-cases, including file, writer and stream export.
        <li>(June 11 2010) Add Spigot support to the ImportAPI and SPI. Like <code>DatabaseImporter</code>, the
            <code>SpigotImporter</code> interface is a new type of Importers. Modifications have also be made to the
            <code>ImportController</code> to support spigot import.
        <li>(June 08 2010) Refactoring and improvements in the Import API and SPI. The refactoring aim is to solve the singleton
            issue with importers and let users implement builders interface that create importers instance. Therefore an
            <code>ImporterBuilder</code> interface has been created and should be registered with the <code>@ServiceProvider</code>
            annotation. The various importers types have been simplified and leave more choice to the implementations about how the
            input is managed. XML and Text file importers has been merged in a <code>FileImporter</code> interface, working with the
            <code>java.io.Reader</code>. Utility static methods, for instance <em>get Document from Reader</em> can now be found in a new
            <code>ImportUtils</code> class. The <code>ImportController</code> has been simplified for File import and now accepts
            <code>java.io.Reader</code> also. The main improvement on these modules in the support of UI components for importers.
            The aim is to let importers define an <code>ImporterUI</code> implementation to manage settings of these importers.
        <li>(June 04 2010) Improvements in the GraphAPI identifiers management. The system is now storing String
        identifiers coming from users. New getters and setters methods have been created in <code>Graph</code>:
        <ul><li><code>Graph.setId(Node, String)</code></li>
            <li><code>Graph.setId(Edge, String)</code></li>
            <li><code>Graph.getNode(String)</code></li>
            <li><code>Graph.getEdge(String)</code></li></ul>
        The <code>NodeData.setId()</code> and <code>EdgeData.setId()</code> methods have been removed, compatibility can't be kept.
        Factory has also be changed to allow to create elements with String ID directly, as it's not possible anymore to
        do it from <code>NodeData</code>.
        <li>(June 02 2010) Changes in AttributesAPI with event management. The lookup system in <code>AttributeTable</code>
        has been replaced by a more traditional event management system, with new <code>AttributeEvent</code> and
        <code>AttributeListener</code> interfaces. The dispatch implementation is also now on a separate thread.</li>
        <li>(May 08 2010) Changes in Import modules to separate core and user interfaces. The <code>ImportController</code> is now
        doing import task only and a new <code>ImportControllerUI</code> is displaying the user interface (Report Panel). The
        <code>ImportControllerUI</code> interface is located in the DesktopProject module and should be user to properly
        import file from Plugins. The <code>ImportController</code> methods could be used from the toolkit.</li>
        <li>(April 30 2010) Change FilterController.filter() to FilterController.filterVisible()  and FilterController.select()
            to FilterController.selectVisible(). The controller is managing this process in a separate thread, with progress,
            and takes care of properties change. A more simple direct way to filter is required for headless access.
            The FilterController.filter()  has been created and return the GraphView builded by the filter process.</li>
        <li>(April 24 2010) Expose basic visualization features in a newly created Visualization API. No proper visualization
            API exists but its creation is necessary to avoid implementation module dependencies. </li>       
        <li>(April 17 2010) In PreviewAPI, the background color has been put in the PreviewModel. The PreviewController has
            been updated as well. </li>
        <li>(March 28 2010) Add a <code>doImport()</code> method in <code>ImportController</code> that accepts
            <code>InputStream</code>. In ImportAPI also, add <code>getWeight()</code> in EdgeDraft to let importers
            increment weight. New <code> AttributeUtils</code>  methods. Progress in GraphAPI and ImportAPI documentation.</li>
        <li>(Feb 17 2010) Change in ImportAPI to support bounded time intervals. Add methods
				that manage <code>TimeIntervalMin</code> and <code>TimeIntervalMax</code>. Changes in
				GraphAPI about elements counting. Henceforth only enabled elements are counted, in node
				and edge counting, but also in degree methods. This counting is more logical, as it match
				with the number of elements returned by <code>getNodes()</code> and <code>getEdges()</code>.</li>
        <li>(Feb 7 2010) Initial import, for 0.7alpha milestone. Half of
            APIs are fully documented and the rest needs to be soon. Expose
            only Core APIs, that plugins could need by now. Friend
            packages exists, in particular between Plugin and PluginUI
            modules but they are not shown here. Netbeans APIs documentation
            dependencies are missing, thus see
            <a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/index.html">Netbeans API Index</a>.
            Due to early development status, most of APIs are still marked as
            under development. Moreover APIs marked as stable are also suspected to
            change, but with much less impact than ones marked as under development.</li></ul>
