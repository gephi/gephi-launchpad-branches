        API for real-time layout algorithm tasks and proper user control.
        <p>
            This API hosts layout algorithms and control their execution. It
            registers all the <code>LayoutBuilder</code> implementations and
            manages runnging states for serving UI.
        </p>
        <p>
            The controller hosts the current <code>LayoutModel</code>, that
            stores execution states for the workspace it belongs.
