        API for importing data from any support.
        <p>
            This API defines a <b>secure import flow</b>, that allows to import data in
            a container, then checks the container for data consistency and finally
            process data and appended them to <code>GraphAPI</code> and
            <code>AttributesAPI</code>.
        </p>
        <p>See <code>org.gephi.io.importer.spi</code> package for defining new
            importers and <code>org.gephi.io.processor.spi</code> for processors.
            Processors come after importers and are responsible for appending
            import results.</p>
        <p>
            Import tasks can also carefully log what they do and where some
            problems where found. The report can then be displayed to users.
