/**
 * Interface modules implement to notify the system they can read/write part
 * of the .gephi project file to serialize states and data.
 * <h3>How saving a project works</h3>
 * <ol><li>The saving task is looking for all implementations of this interface and
 * asks to return an XML element that represents data for each workspace.</li>
 * <li>All of these elements are written in the .gephi project file.</li></ol>
 * <h3>How loading a project works</h3>
 * <ol><li>The loading task is looking for all implementations of this interface and
 * asks for the identifier returned by <code>getIdentifier()</code>.</li>
 * <li>When traversing the gephi project XML document it tries to match markups with
 * identifiers. When match, call this provider <code>readXML()</code> method
 * with the XML element.</li></ol>
 * Thus this interface allows any module to serialize and deserialize its data
 * to gephi project files.
